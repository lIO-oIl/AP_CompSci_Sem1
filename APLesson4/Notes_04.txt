- %[#]s creates a spacing that allows for indent for alignment, so long as all the lengths are within parameters
- %[#].[#1]f allows for the spacing to be 10 characters, but also includes "#1" amount of decimal places in it
	- If "#1" does not include all the decimal places, the excessive portions would be cut off.
- If numbers exceeed given parameters, the printf function would not space correctly
- For sake of formating, "public void FUNCNAME () {}" should be used to include any change of existing variables
- Parameters are only visible to the function itself, and will work so long as the correct values were plugged in
- You would need to make a new class in order to run varNAME.FUNCNAME(vars)
	- ClassNAME varNAME = new ClassNAME();
